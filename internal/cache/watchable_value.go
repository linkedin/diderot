// iterateSubscribers returns a SubscriberSetIterator that iterates over all the unique subscribers
// to this value. This means if a subscriber is subscribed to this value both with a wildcard and an
// explicit subscription, the returned sequence will only yield the handler once.
//
// Author's note: there is a known race condition in this function if a subscriber is present in more
// than one iterator. The loop iterates through the given iterators in order, and looks back at
// previous iterators to check whether a given SubscriptionHandler has already been notified with
// SubscriberSet.IsSubscribed. Suppose the following sequence:
//  1. A SubscriptionHandler "foo" is present both as an explicit and wildcard subscriber to this
//     value.
//  2. iterateSubscribers completes the iteration over the explicit subscribers, yielding foo once.
//  3. foo unsubscribes from the explicit SubscriberSet as iterateSubscribers begins iterating over the
//     wildcard SubscriberSet. iterateSubscribers encounters foo in the wildcard SubscriberSet and checks
//     whether foo is present in the explicit SubscriberSet (which it has already iterated over), sees
//     that foo is not explicitly subscribed, and yields foo again since it believes it is the first time
//     foo is encountered.
//
// Such a scenario can lead to foo being notified of the same update twice, which is undesirable but
// acceptable. Note however that the sequence of subscriptions "subscribe explicit" -> "subscribe
// wildcard" -> "unsubscribe explicit" does not actually exist in the standard Envoy flow, meaning
// this edge case is extremely unlikely. This is because iterateSubscribers always iterates through
// the subscriber sets in the same order: ExplicitSubscription -> GlobSubscription ->
// WildcardSubscription. The [known flow] of "subscribe wildcard" -> "subscribe explicit" ->
// "unsubscribe wildcard" is therefore completely unaffected by this and behaves as expected where
// foo is only yielded once.
//
// Possible alternatives to this iteration approach were considered:
//
// # Reverse checking order
//
// Instead of checking whether a SubscriptionHandler was already yielded by looking at *previous*
// SubscriberSets, iterateSubscribers could look at the *upcoming* iterators and determine whether a
// handler will eventually be yielded by a subsequent iterator, and skip yielding the handler from
// this iterator. While this addresses the edge case above, it symmetrically opens a significantly
// worse edge case in the reverse scenario:
//  1. A SubscriptionHandler "foo" is present both as an explicit and wildcard subscriber to this
//     value.
//  2. iterateSubscribers completes the iteration over the explicit subscribers, skipping foo since it
//     sees that it is currently present in the wildcard SubscriberSet.
//  3. foo unsubscribes from the wildcard SubscriberSet as iterateSubscribers begins iterating over the
//     wildcard SubscriberSet. foo is never encountered again, meaning it will never be notified of the
//     resource update.
//
// This edge case means updates will altogether be dropped rather than delivered twice, which is
// unacceptable. Not only that, unlike the current iteration approach, the [known flow] is likely to
// trigger this edge, making this approach completely non-viable.
//
// # Running set
//
// The obvious way to iterate through the union of subscribers would be to simply use a set to keep
// track of all the SubscriptionHandlers that have already been yielded. This however defeats the
// very point of the SubscriberSet data structure in the first place, which *avoids* storing state
// for each subscriber. It would create memory pressure as each invocation of iterateSubscribers
// would create a new map which would get promptly discarded once the invocation exits. The memory
// pressure could be addressed by leveraging a sync.Pool to allow reusing these sets, but it would
// only introduce complexity and overhead in an already complex loop. As such, this was ultimately
// deemed not necessary as the current solution will only duplicate notifications
// unknown/non-standard subscription flows.
